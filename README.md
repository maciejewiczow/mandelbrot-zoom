# mandelbrot-zoom
Somewhat deep mandelbrot set zoom with three.js webgl shader

Live example hosted on [heroku](https://mandelbrot-zoom.herokuapp.com)

For now you can move camera around using arrow keys and pause rendering with spacebar. 
My goal is to make it zoomable and draggable, kind of like map in google maps.
